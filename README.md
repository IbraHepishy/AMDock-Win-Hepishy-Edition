# AMDock: **A***ssisted* **M***olecular* **Dock***ing with Autodock4 and Autodock Vina with PLIP (Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler) integration*
AMDock (Assisted Molecular Docking) is a user-friendly graphical tool to assist in the docking of protein-ligand 
complexes using Autodock-Vina or AutoDock4. This tool integrates several external programs for processing docking input 
files, define the search space (box) and perform docking under user’s supervision, then analyze the results using PLIP integration.

**Version 1.5.x for Windows** (**Build 1.5.2**)

# INSTALL (Windows)

### AMDock

AMDock Windows version doesn´t need to be "installed". Just:

- Unzip the `*.zip` file

- Run `AMDock.exe`

If you wish, you can create a program shortcut where you want or simply pin it to Start.

### PLIP Integration

Currently, it works well with AutoDock Vina


- Python 3.10 - 3.13 is required (Preferentially 3.11)
- run `setup.bat` in plip folder and it's gonna take care of everything
- Click `PLIP Interactions Analysis` at the result tab after finishing AMDock docking process

All generated plip files will be generated inside the result folder

# UNINSTALL

Just search the installation directory and delete it.
